Hello,if you're interested in my portfolio,read this:

- by clicking on my name (it turns orange on mouseover) you can open a more detailed section about me that includes links;
- the 'Inspire,Create,Repeat' website created in Wordpress doesn't have anything you're supposed to click on,it's just a page with my darwings (yes,they're mine);
- on clicking the 'Untitled 9' tile you should open the website with the login form already filled with login data.in case it doesn't work,the credentials are login:user password:12345
- the 'Portfolio' tile takes you here and you can look through the code;
- the contact section doesn't hold anything out of the ordinary,it's just contact information.

thank you for reading through this,i hope it made navigating through my portfolio and projects easier.
I will keep it updated with newer stuff coming soon so if you revisit this in the future,it maight have even more projects in it.
